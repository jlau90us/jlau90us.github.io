        There is a lot of ambiguity around what the term "digital" means in how it
        is used today. The term Digital was born out of the rise of computers and
        the processing power that came with it. In order for computers to process
        information, it had to be stored in a digital format that was recognizable
        by machine language and computer code. <br><br>

        Advances in sensor technology has created a boom of digital information and
        when combined with the increased availability of wireless access to the
        internet, an incredible need to store and process data was created.<br><br>

        In the most recent days, a new invention known as cloud computing has allowed
        unprecedented storage and processing of data through cloud computing algorithms
        that enable massive parallel processing and storage across an unlimited
        number of computers, servers, and data centers.<br><br>

        This seemingly limitless amount of storage and processing capabilities has
        also now unlocked new methods in data analytics. Where complex simulations
        on massive data sets used to take months to process, cloud computing can
        return results in just minutes or even seconds. This advance has now unlocked
        the real possibility of applying artificial intelligence and machine learning
        to understanding data in a new way.<br><br>

        While there are still challenges in how we employ these technologies broadly,
        it is an incredibly exciting time because we these new advances in AI and
        cloud computing are driving new discoveries into scientific research and
        productivity, and redefining the realm of what is possible.
